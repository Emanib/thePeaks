This article was inaccurate. In particular it stated that Judge Peter Rook QC had told a defendant that she must represent herself. It also incorrectly suggested this was a “legal first” and that the decision was linked to ongoing industrial action on the part of the Bar. In fact, the Judge had not made such a ruling and had made extensive efforts to assist the defendant to obtain representation.

        body: '<p>The Guardian Weekly has a split cover focus this week, depending on where you are reading, with extended coverage of both stories inside the magazine.</p> <p>Our North America edition splashes on the US supreme court decision to reverse women’s abortion rights. Having been leaked in May, the news was not entirely unexpected<strong> </strong>but nonetheless sent shock waves around America and the world. With many now fearing what a court dominated by religious conservatives will do next, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidsmith">David Smith</a> examines the political fallout and how, if at all, it could be countered. Then on the Opinion pages, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sonia-sodha">Sonia Sodha</a> argues that liberals’ faith in the courts to preserve abortion rights was misguided from the start.</p> <p>For readers elsewhere, we return to the war in Ukraine. In Europe, leaders from the European Council, G7 and Nato were meeting this week,<strong> </strong>at a critical juncture for the conflict. Amid fears that Russia is gaining the upper hand on several fronts, it seems clear that the west needs a strategic rethink over how to tighten economic and military pressure on Vladimir Putin, without leading to a backlash among western consumers and starvation in the global south as a result of grain blockades.</p> <p>Diplomatic editor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrickwintour">Patrick Wintour</a> sets the scene at a pivotal moment. Energy correspondent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alex-lawson">Alex Lawson</a> asks what will happen if Russia shuts off gas supplies to Europe this winter, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lorenzo-tondo">Lorenzo Tondo</a> reports from Kyiv, where the spectre of war has returned for the first time in weeks.</p> <p>Look out for a couple of great longer reads this week. First, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/louisa-lim">Louisa Lim</a>’s search for the King of Kowloon, an enigmatic street prophet and graffiti artist who died a few years ago, but whose work is mysteriously reappearing around Hong Kong.</p> <p>Then, there’s a brilliantly thought-provoking piece on how to explain racism to children – and raise an antiracist – from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ibram-kendi">Ibram X Kendi</a>, an American author who has taught millions of people to think differently.</p> <p>As Glastonbury returned after a long, pandemic-enforced absence<strong>, </strong>we bring you a wrap-up from the world’s biggest greenfield festival. And there’s a candid interview with Phoebe Bridgers, one of the festival’s headline acts, who looks to be on the brink of global superstardom.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://support.theguardian.com/uk/subscribe/weekly?promoCode=WWM53X">Get the Guardian Weekly magazine delivered to your home address.</a></strong></p>',
